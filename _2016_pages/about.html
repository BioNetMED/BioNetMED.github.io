      <h2 class="first">Abstract</h2>

      <p>
        Network science has been widely used to model biomedical systems from genetic interactions to epidemic spreading, as well as the relation found in large biomedical datasets, either as correlation measurements or within AI tools. Leveraging the versatility of network science, BioNetMED (Biological Networks from Multiomics, Epidemiology and Diagnosis) seeks to bring together leading researchers at the intersections of network science and biomedicine in order to generate a multidisciplinary dialogue that culminates in the translation of knowledge on modeling and analysis of complex biomedical systems. This way, BioNetMED will create an environment for the development of explainable and actionable inferences within biology and medicine.
